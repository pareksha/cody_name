# cody_name  
The code https://github.com/pareksha/cody_name/blob/master/my_name.py runs on python 3.
My name will be printed depending on the thickness entered by the user.
The output comes best for thickness 4 or 5 as thickness = 6 goes out of the screen and thickness <= 3 is too less to fit the 
format.

# Output  
For output refer image https://github.com/pareksha/cody_name/blob/master/my_name.png 

# Methods used  
I have made use of .ljust() , .rjust() and .center()
